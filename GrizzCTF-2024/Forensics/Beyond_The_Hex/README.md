# Beyond the Hex (250 Points)


- The file's extension may be misleading. Look beyond it to understand the file's true content.
- Consider using command-line tools like `file`, `xxd`, or hex editors to inspect the file more closely.
- Magic bytes are your key to solving this challenge. They are located at the beginning of the file and can tell you what the file really is.

## Tools

- `file`: Determine the type of file.
- `xxd` or similar hex editors: View the file's hexadecimal representation.
